Healthcare Data Exploratory Data Analysis

Introduction

This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) of healthcare data obtained from Kaggle. The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of the healthcare dataset, including patient demographics, medical conditions, billing amounts, and more.

Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is named healthcare_dataset.csv. It contains information about patients' demographics, medical conditions, hospital details, billing amounts, and more. The dataset is provided in CSV format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA includes the following steps:

Loading the dataset and understanding its structure.
Exploring basic statistics of numerical variables such as age, billing amount, etc.
Handling missing values by dropping or imputing them.
Visualizing distributions of numerical variables using histograms and boxplots.
Visualizing the relationship between numerical variables and the target variable using boxplots.
Exploring categorical variables through countplots.
Visualizing correlations between numerical features using heatmaps.

Requirements

To run the analysis notebooks, you need the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Usage

Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the Jupyter notebooks healthcare_eda.ipynb in your Jupyter environment.
Run each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis step by step.

Results

The analysis provides insights into various aspects of the healthcare dataset, including patient demographics, medical conditions, billing amounts, and more. Visualizations help in understanding the distributions and relationships between different variables.
